This will generate a table of VINs, gotten from eBay Motors. You can change settings to narrow down what you want.

HOW TO:
1) copy these files into a folder
2) make sure you are on a Linux server with PHP5 and Apache installed, and the files are in some folder that you can access
3) navigate to your server (normally 'localhost' or '127.0.0.1' in ther server's web browser
4) change options, click "GO!", and wait a few seconds
5) PROFIT!
